# Power-BI-Dashboard-Presentation-AdventureWorks
AdventureWorks Power BI Dashboard Project
This project simulates a real-world business intelligence workflow for AdventureWorks Cycles, a fictional manufacturing company. As the Business Intelligence Analyst, I transformed raw data into interactive, professional-quality reports and dashboards to support strategic decision-making.

The project follows four key stages of the BI process: Data Preparation, Data Modeling, DAX Calculations, and Data Visualization.

**Final Dashboards**
Executive Dashboard: High-level KPIs, key trends, and strategic insights
Map Dashboard: Business activity by region (interactive world map)
Product Insights Dashboard: Product-level performance and category trends
Customer Insights Dashboard: Detailed view of customer behavior and segmentation

**Project Stages**

**STAGE 1: Connecting & Shaping Data**
Tools: Power Query

Connected to various data sources (Excel, web, databases)
Cleaned and transformed raw data
Applied data profiling for quality assurance
Used Power Query tools for:
Column transformations (text, numeric, date/time)
Creating index, conditional, and rolling calendar columns
Grouping, pivoting, unpivoting
Merging and appending queries
Parameterizing data sources

**STAGE 2: Creating a Relational Data Model**
Focus: Data Modeling Best Practices

Built a star schema with clearly defined fact and dimension tables
Applied principles of normalization
Configured relationships (cardinality, filter direction, active/inactive)
Added hierarchies and standardized data formats
Optimized model layout for clarity and performance

**STAGE 3: Adding Calculated Fields with DAX**
Focus: Business Logic & Metrics

Built calculated columns and measures using DAX
Used key functions including:
CALCULATE, FILTER, ALL, RELATED
Iterators like SUMX, AVERAGEX, etc.
Conditional logic (IF, SWITCH)
Time intelligence functions (YTD, MTD, previous periods)
Developed both implicit and explicit measures to support visual KPIs

**STAGE 4: Visualizing Data with Reports**
Focus: Dashboard Design & Interactivity

Followed data visualization best practices
Designed four dashboards using:
Cards, KPIs, bar/line charts, tables, maps
Custom visuals and slicer panels
Added interactive features:
Drillthroughs, bookmarks, tooltips, dynamic slicers
Top N filters and numeric parameters
Role-level security (RLS)


**Advanced Features & Highlight**s
Smart visuals: Key Influencers, Decomposition Trees, Smart Narratives
Natural Language Q&A integration
Performance optimization for large datasets
Clean, intuitive layout based on modern dashboard UI/UX principles
